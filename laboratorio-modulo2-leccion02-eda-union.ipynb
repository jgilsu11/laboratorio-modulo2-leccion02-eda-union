    "## Los datos\n",
    "\n",
    "Para este laboratorio, trabajarás con los siguientes conjuntos de datos:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`netflix_originals.csv`**: Contiene información sobre producciones originales de Netflix. Las columnas que nos encontraremos en este conjunto de datos son: \n",

    "\n",
    "A lo largo de los laboratorios de Pandas, trabajarás con estos conjuntos de datos (o con los derivados del Laboratorio), algunas de las actividades que realizaremos son:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Exploración de datos y análisis exploratorio (EDA) para familiarizarse con los conjuntos de datos.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Realización de uniones entre conjuntos de datos, aplicando diferentes técnicas de *merging* y analizando la relevancia de cada método.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uso de funciones de selección y filtrado (`loc`, `iloc`) para extraer información clave.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Desarrollo de análisis descriptivos y visualización de patrones para comprender mejor las decisiones estratégicas de la plataforma.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Unión de `netflix_titles.csv` con `netflix_originals.csv`:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Análisis de contenido original:**  Identificarás los títulos que son producciones originales de Netflix y los compararás con los títulos adquiridos. Este análisis te permitirá:\n",
    "\n",
    "     - Comparar la diversidad de géneros entre los títulos originales y no originales.\n",
    "\n",
    "     - Evaluar si ciertos géneros o tipos de contenido (como documentales o series) son más frecuentes en las producciones originales.\n",
    "\n",
    "     - Investigar si la producción original se concentra en determinados países o idiomas.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Evaluación de contenido:** En esta etapa, explorarás si las producciones originales de Netflix tienden a recibir mejores o peores evaluaciones en comparación con el contenido adquirido. Algunas preguntas que se buscarán responder incluyen:\n",
    "\n",
    "     - ¿Los títulos originales tienen una calificación promedio superior en plataformas como IMDB?\n",
    "\n",
    "     - ¿Son las producciones originales más consistentes en términos de calidad percibida?\n",
    "\n",
    "     - ¿Existen diferencias en la popularidad de los títulos originales según su género o país de origen?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Identificación de tendencias:**  Por último, este análisis te permitirá explorar cómo ha evolucionado la estrategia de contenido de Netflix a lo largo del tiempo. Algunos puntos clave a investigar serán:\n",
    "\n",
    "     - ¿Cómo ha crecido la producción original en comparación con la adquisición de contenido?\n",
    "\n",
    "     - ¿Qué géneros o tipos de contenido han recibido mayor inversión en los últimos años?\n",
    "     \n",
    "     - ¿Existen patrones en los países o idiomas de las producciones originales, especialmente en relación con la expansión global de Netflix?\n",

    "## Ejercicio: Análisis y Enriquecimiento del Catálogo de Netflix\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parte 1: Análisis Exploratorio de Datos (EDA)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Carga de los datos:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Deberás cargar los dos conjuntos de datos que te hemos proporcionado para realizar este Laboratorio:\n",
    "\n",
    "     - `netflix_originals.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "     - `netflix_titles.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "   Deberás revisar la estructura de cada conjunto de datos utilizando los métodos aprendidos durante la lección.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Análisis de columnas y consistencia:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Deberás hacer un análisis exploratorio de cada uno de los conjuntos de datos. Será obligatorio que incluyas las conclusiones generales obtenidas de cada uno de los análisis exploratorios en el Jupyter Notebook de tus soluciones.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Explorar qué columnas contiene cada conjunto de datos y cuáles son sus tipos de datos. Identificar si hay valores nulos o duplicados.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Algunas preguntas que nos podemos plantear en esta fase son (recuerda que esto es solo un ejemplo, y que podemos explorar todo lo que queramos/necesitemos para entender lo mejor posible los conjuntos de datos):\n",
    "\n",
    "      - ¿Cuáles son los tipos de datos de cada columna? Nos puede ayudar a detectar si algún tipo de dato está incorrectamente asignado, como fechas almacenadas como cadenas de texto.\n",
    "\n",
    "      - ¿Existen valores nulos? ¿En qué columnas están? Este paso es crucial para decidir si deben ser eliminados, rellenados o ignorados.\n",
    "\n",
    "      - ¿Cuántos títulos únicos hay en cada conjunto de datos? Nos puede permitir verificar si existen títulos duplicados que puedan distorsionar el análisis.\n",
    "\n",
    "      - ¿Qué géneros tenemos en el conjunto de datos? Esto nos puede ayudar a identificar los géneros más populares o incluso a identificar una posible limpieza de dicha columna para poder extraer conclusiones más claras en nuestro análisis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parte 2: Unión de Datos\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Realización de la unión:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Deberás realizar la unión que consideres más apropiada entre `netflix_titles.csv` y `netflix_originals.csv`. Además, deberás justificar el tipo de unión que has realizado.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Esto nos ayudará a contestar preguntas más adelente del tipo:\n",
    "\n",
    "     - ¿Cuántos títulos en `netflix_titles.csv` son producciones originales de Netflix?\n",
    "\n",
    "     - ¿Hay diferencias significativas en la puntuación de IMDB entre títulos originales y no originales?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parte 3: Uso de `loc` e `iloc`\n",
    "\n",
    "Usando el DataFrame creado en la Parte 2: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Filtrado de datos con `loc`:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Selecciona todas las filas donde el tipo de contenido sea “Movie”.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Muestra solo los títulos (title) y la duración (duration) de todos los contenidos que sean de tipo “TV Show”.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Selecciona todas las filas donde el país sea “United States”.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Muestra todas las películas (type = “Movie”) y selecciona las columnas title y director.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Selecciona los títulos (title) y géneros (listed_in) de todas las producciones lanzadas en 2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Selecciona las filas donde la columna director esté vacía y muestra solo los títulos (title).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Acceso a datos específicos con `iloc`:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Selecciona las primeras 5 filas del conjunto de datos y muestra solo las columnas title, director y country.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Muestra las últimas 5 filas del conjunto de datos y selecciona las columnas title y description.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Selecciona las primeras 10 filas del dataset y muestra las columnas desde la segunda hasta la quinta (incluidas). \n",
    "\n",
    "   - Muestra las últimas 7 filas del dataset y selecciona las columnas title, director, y country usando índices posicionales.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Selecciona las filas desde la 15 hasta la 25 (incluidas) y muestra las primeras 4 columnas.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Muestra las filas 20 a 30 y solo las columnas title, release_year, y rating usando índices posicionales.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTA IMPORTANTE**: Antes de terminar el lab, guarda el conjunto de datos creado en la fase de unión para trabajar con el en las siguientes lecciones. "

Ya que se observa que el valor de evaluación mínimo es de 2,5 mientras qu ele máximo en esa escala es 9 (lo que no quiere decir que el 9 sea bueno y el 2,5 malo por eso hay que preguntar) su media es de 6.21 y la mediana un 6,3 lo que implica que se distribuyen las valoraciones más o menos equitativamente (sin valores atípicos)\n",

    "- RUNTIME cuenta con una media de 94,67 de lo que se interpreta que podrían ser minutos con un valor minimo y máximo de 4 y 209 respectivamente y debido a que su mediana es 97, se podría decir que se tiende muy levemente (si lo interpretamos como duración en minutos) a una mayor duración de los títulos.\n",

Por otro lado, las opciones de idioma incluidas en menos títulos son por lo general aquellas que incluyen más de un idioma lo que puede estar relacionado con los costes para Netflix ya que por un lado, tener que traducir los títulos es un sobrecoste a la vez que también es mucho más fácil encontarr traductores de los idiomas más hablados del mundo que casualmente son los que agrupan la mayor parte de títulos.\n",
